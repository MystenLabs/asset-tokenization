# asset-tokenization
The idea is to create something similar to launchpads but instead of creating a new NFT contract, we would be creating a new type T for a TokenizedAsset&lt;T>. A helpful mental model would be to think of the FNFT contract as a type of Coin, in the sense that it will be implemented with the Balance module.
